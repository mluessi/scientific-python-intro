scientific-python-intro
=======================

Presentation slides for an introduction to Python for scientific computing

Initial version created by converting the slides by @agramfort

https://github.com/agramfort/scientific-python-intro-45mins

to an IPython notebook.

To present the slides using a live IPython notebook, "slidemode" from

https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions

can be used.

You can use the IPython Notebook Viewer to have a look at the slides:
